    <p> A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto[a] is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of 
        exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, 
        to uphold or maintain it.[2] It has, from a financial point of view, grown to be its own asset class. 
        However, on the contrary to other asset classes like equities or commodities, sectors have not been officially defined as of yet, 
        though abstract versions of them exist.[3]
        Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to
        secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.
        [4][5][6] Despite the term that has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created, 
        cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and varying legal treatments have been applied 
        to them in various jurisdicitons, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies.
        Cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.[7][8][9] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain
         the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token 
         in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, 
         newly minted tokens, or other such reward mechanisms.[10] Trace amounts of cryptocurrency that are not worth spending because of the fee 
         needed are called "dust".[11]<br>
