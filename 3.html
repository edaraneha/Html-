    <h3>Profile</h3>    
    <p>I'm very passionate at learning and developing new things that may
        improve my skills. I'm a good problem solver. I am capable of
        learning new things under the guidance and self. I can work with 
        both team and individually.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>Identification of Leaf Disease Using CNN<br>
        <ul>
        <li>The timely identification and early prevention of crop diseases
        are essential for improving production.</li>
       <li> In this paper, deep 
        convolutional-neural-network (CNN) models are implemented
        to identify and diagnose diseases in plants from their leaves, 
        since CNNs have achieved impressive results in the field of machine vision. </li>
       <li> Standard CNN models require a large number of parameters and higher 
        computation cost. </li>
        <li>In this paper, we replaced standard convolution
        with depth=separable convolution, which reduces the parameter number and computation cost. </li>
    </ul>
